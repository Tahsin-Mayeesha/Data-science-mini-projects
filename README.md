# Exploratory Data Analysis

These projects were done in the first phase of my data science learning. Many of the datasets are from FiveThirtyEight public data, such as [Analyzing Movie Reviews](https://github.com/Tahsin-Mayeesha/Data-science-mini-projects/tree/master/Analyzing-Movie-Reviews) and [Police Killings](https://github.com/Tahsin-Mayeesha/Data-science-mini-projects/tree/master/Police-Killings). The other ones are from various sources such as Reddit and course work from Udacity.
